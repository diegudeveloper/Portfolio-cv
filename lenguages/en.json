I am a Frontend Developer apprentice and “Make it happen” is my motto.<br><br> I started in the tech world in 2019 as a frontend developer, and although it sounds cliché, I am a technology lover, not about the one that is consumed, but the one that is created.<br><br> I am an autodidact. I learned Html, Css, Sass, Bootstrap, Gig and Github by my own and now I am leaning Javascript and React, this to be able of carry out more professional projects. At the moment I've created +20 projects by my own and I want to keep going. <br><br> I try to stay true to my core value: #MakeItHappen, because I am convinced that I can be part of the community that changes the world, the people who create technology, the people I have always wanted to be. But above all, I want to become the best version of me.<br><br> Tools I use in my Projects:",
